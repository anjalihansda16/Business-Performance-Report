1. Performance by Country:
**EIRE:** 
- Revenue peaks in July (~40K) and September (~35K), with noticeable troughs in March (~10K) and November (~10K).
- Order Count follows a similar pattern, with peaks in September (~1,000 orders) and November (~950 orders), indicating high customer activity.

**Netherlands:**
